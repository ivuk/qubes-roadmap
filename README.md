Roadmap for Qubes OS
=====================

This repository is used to track milestones/roadmap/features for Qubes OS.

<img src="https://rootkovska.github.io/qubes-roadmap/roadmap.png">

Also avilable as [a PDF](https://rootkovska.github.io/qubes-roadmap/roadmap.pdf).

It's currently maintained as Graphviz's dot file which describes a graph showing
planned features, their deps and when we expect them to be released.

The attached Makefile can be used to render the dot file into a nice PDF (or you
can take a look at the rendered PNG and PDF linked above).

This is a very high-level view of the planned tasks, for more details take a
look at [our ticketing system](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/milestones).

This repository, as any other related to the Qubes OS Project, as well as the
resulting files (linked above), can be verified by checking the signatures on
the respective git tags (either for the master or gh-branch).
